<h2>2. Time Display Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
<div class="callout callout-green">
  <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Time displays are based on your device's internal clock and timezone settings. The app does not guarantee the accuracy of time displays. Do not rely on this app for time-critical activities, scheduling, or any purpose where precise timekeeping is required.
</div>
<p>Time displays in Time and Weather Sol (including the analogue clock, digital time display, and world clocks) are derived from your device's system clock and:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>May be inaccurate</strong> &mdash; If your device's clock is not correctly set or has drifted, the displayed time will be incorrect</li>
  <li><strong>May not reflect timezone changes</strong> &mdash; World clock displays depend on timezone data that may not include the most recent daylight saving time transitions or timezone boundary changes</li>
  <li><strong>Are not independently synchronised</strong> &mdash; The App does not independently verify or synchronise time from external NTP servers or atomic clock sources</li>
  <li><strong>May vary between devices</strong> &mdash; The same timezone may display differently on different devices depending on system clock accuracy and timezone database versions</li>
  <li><strong>Are not audited or certified</strong> &mdash; Time displays are not calibrated against any authoritative time standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Under no circumstances should you rely on time displays in Time and Weather Sol for time-critical activities, including but not limited to scheduling, transportation, aviation, medical timing, financial trading deadlines, legal deadlines, or any other purpose where precise timekeeping is required.</strong></p>

<h2>3. Weather Data Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
