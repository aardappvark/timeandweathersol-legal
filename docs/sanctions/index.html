<h1>Sanctions &amp; Restricted Regions Policy</h1>
<span class="updated">Effective date: 17 February 2026 &middot; Last updated: 17 February 2026 &middot; Version 1.0</span>

  <strong>Compliance commitment:</strong> Time and Weather Sol is committed to complying with all applicable international sanctions laws and regulations. This policy describes how we implement geographic restrictions to meet our legal obligations.

<div class="callout callout-green">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This list is maintained based on publicly available sanctions programme information and may be updated without prior notice as sanctions designations change. We review and update this list periodically to reflect current international sanctions.

<h2>3. How Geographic Screening Works</h2>
<p>Time and Weather Sol uses a multi-layered approach to determine the user's geographic location. This screening occurs <strong>at app startup</strong> and uses the following detection methods in priority order:</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Priority</th><th>Method</th><th>Data source</th><th>Reliability</th></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>SIM card country code</td><td>TelephonyManager (SIM operator)</td><td>Highest &mdash; physical SIM is issued in a specific country</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>Network carrier country</td><td>TelephonyManager (network operator)</td><td>High &mdash; carrier-reported country code</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>Geocoder reverse lookup</td><td>Android Geocoder (coarse location)</td><td>High &mdash; network-based location resolution</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>Device locale setting</td><td>Android system locale</td><td>Moderate &mdash; user-configurable but indicative</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>Timezone analysis</td><td>Android timezone setting</td><td>Low &mdash; used only as supplementary signal</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>3.1 Privacy-preserving design</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All screening is performed <strong>entirely on-device</strong> &mdash; no location data is transmitted to any server for sanctions screening purposes</li>
  <li>Coarse location (when available) is used only for Geocoder reverse lookup and is <strong>immediately discarded</strong> after obtaining the country code</li>
  <li>No location history is stored, logged, or recorded for sanctions screening purposes</li>
  <li>The location permission can be denied &mdash; the app falls back to SIM/carrier/locale/timezone methods</li>
  <li>Note: Time and Weather Sol also uses location data for weather retrieval (see our <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for full details on all location data handling)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 What happens when a restricted region is detected</h3>
<p>If any detection layer indicates the device is associated with a restricted jurisdiction:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The App displays an informational screen explaining that Time and Weather Sol is not available in the detected region</li>
  <li>The screen identifies the detected region code for transparency</li>
  <li>Access to the App's features (time display, weather display, price display, wallet connection) is restricted</li>
  <li>No data is collected, transmitted, or processed beyond the initial region check</li>
</ol>

<h3>3.3 Limitations of geographic screening</h3>
<p>We acknowledge that on-device geographic screening has inherent limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SIM-based detection may not reflect the user's current physical location (e.g., travelling with a foreign SIM)</li>
  <li>Location services depend on device-reported data, which may be inaccurate</li>
  <li>VPNs or location spoofing tools may circumvent geographic restrictions</li>
  <li>Dual-SIM devices may report ambiguous country information</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations do not relieve users of their obligation to comply with applicable laws in their actual jurisdiction (see Section 4).</p>

<h2>4. User Representations and Warranties</h2>
<p>By using Time and Weather Sol, you represent and warrant that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are not currently located in, a resident of, or a national of any jurisdiction listed in Section 2 (Restricted Jurisdictions)</li>
  <li>You are not listed on, or owned or controlled by any person or entity listed on:
    <ul>
      <li>The US OFAC Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List</li>
      <li>The EU Consolidated List of Persons, Groups and Entities Subject to Financial Sanctions</li>
      <li>The UK OFSI Consolidated List of Financial Sanctions Targets</li>
      <li>The Australian DFAT Consolidated List</li>

  <li>You are not acting on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any sanctioned person, entity, or jurisdiction</li>
  <li>You will not use VPNs, proxy services, location spoofing tools, or any other technology to circumvent the geographic restrictions implemented by the App</li>
  <li>You will immediately cease use of the App if your jurisdiction becomes subject to sanctions</li>
  <li>If you are travelling to a sanctioned jurisdiction, you will not access the App while physically present in that jurisdiction</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Consequences of Violation</h2>
<p>If we determine or reasonably suspect that you are using the App in violation of this Policy or applicable sanctions laws:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your access to the App may be immediately terminated</li>
  <li>We reserve the right to cooperate with relevant authorities if required by law</li>
  <li>We may disclose information as required by legal process, subpoena, or government request</li>
  <li>You may be subject to civil or criminal penalties under applicable sanctions laws</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Updates to Restricted Jurisdictions</h2>
<p>International sanctions are dynamic and subject to change. We monitor sanctions designations from OFAC, EU, UK OFSI, and Australian DFAT and will update the restricted jurisdictions list as necessary. Updates may be made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Via App updates (changes to the built-in country list)</li>
  <li>Via updates to this policy document</li>
  <li>Without individual prior notice to users</li>
</ul>
<p>It is your responsibility to be aware of applicable sanctions in your jurisdiction. The list in Section 2 is provided for informational convenience and may not be exhaustive at any given time.</p>

<h2>7. No Legal Advice</h2>
<p>This Sanctions and Restricted Regions Policy is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice regarding sanctions compliance. The sanctions landscape is complex and varies by jurisdiction. If you have questions about whether your use of Time and Weather Sol may be subject to sanctions restrictions, you should consult qualified legal counsel in your jurisdiction.</p>
